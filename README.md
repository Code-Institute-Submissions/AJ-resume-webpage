***Main page:***

At the top of the browser windows there is a menu with logo on the left size and three sub-pages: TECH, Agile and Contact.
Under the menu the user can see main image which refers to my sex and programming interests so the user may assume that the page was created by a female. 
Following underneath we have there colums of the text with descriptions of previous professional experience and simply styled button under each of the section redirecting the user to a previous employer website.
