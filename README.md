# Resume webpage

[Anna Janiak](https://annaweronica.github.io/AJ-resume-webpage/)

Aim of the **resume webpage** is to represent skills and competences which will lead Anna to get a programming job within IT. 


## UX

Target audience of the **resume webpage** is a recruiter and/or potential employer looking for a full stack developer.

**Layout:**

Minimalistic, simple design in  white and black style including images. 
>The only exception is for google map in Contact sub-page.

  2. via Conatct Form which is available on the page under a heading "Drop me a message". The inputs of name and email are mandatory to fill up otherwise the toolip will pop up requires the recruiter to do so.<br>

### Testing

**HTML Validator**

- [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)<br>
  [No errors or warnings to show.](/wireframes/HTML-validated.png)

**CSS Validator**

- [jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)<br>
  [No Error Found.](/wireframes/CSS-validated.png)

**Manual Testing**

Webpage and its responsiveness was tested on follwoing browsers:
- Chrom
- FireFox
- Edge
- Internet Explorer<br>
[Exception: the webpage is not supported on Internet Explorer](/wireframes/Internet-explorer-error.png)

Most common path through the website:

1. On desktop and iPod:

Main page > Tech > Agile > > Contact
Each of these pages leads the recruiter scrolling down through next page to Contact page and the footer at the bottom with also posibility of contact. In some places the recruiter may wanto to be back to another page and he can easily do it clicking on one of the sub-page name on the manu. 
Clicking on TECH will lead him back to the TECH sub-page. 
Clicking on Agile sub-page will lead him back to the Agile.
Clicking on Contact sub-page will lead him back to the Contact. 
Clicking on logo >Anna Janiak< in menu will lead him back to the main page.

2. On mobile devices the path happens as follows but the menu collapses into a burger. Once cklicking on the burger it will lead the recruiter to the items of the menu and the order happens as the steps above. There is one more menu sub-page to be back to the main page on mobile devices: *Home* re-directing you to the main page. You can still be back to the main page clicking on logo.

**TESTING THE FEATURES**

> - git add .
> - git commit -m "name"
> - git push<br>

**All commends were made as the work incrementation was made progressively and prevented from any code incrementation loss.**
