# Resume webpage

[Anna Janiak](https://annaweronica.github.io/AJ-resume-webpage/)

Aim of the **resume webpage** is to represent skills and competences which will lead me to get a programming job within IT. 


## UX

Target audience for the **resume webpage** is a recruiter and/or potential employer looking for a full stack developer.

**Layout:**

Minimalistic, simple design in  white and black style including images. The only exception is for google map in Contact sub-page.

***Main page:***

At the top of the browser windows there is a menu with logo on the left size and three sub-pages: TECH, Agile and Contact.
Under the menu the user can see main image with female touch. Following underneath we have there colums of the text with descriptions of previous professional experience and simply styled button under each of the section redirecting the user to a previous employer website.
