Aim of the **resume webpage** is to represent skills and competences which will lead Anna to get a programming job within IT. 


## UX

Target audience of the **resume webpage** is a recruiter and/or potential employer looking for a full stack developer.

**Layout:**

Minimalistic, simple design in  white and black style including images.
